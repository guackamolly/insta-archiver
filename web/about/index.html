                        <b>Story Focus</b>: While we archive your entire
                        profile, our tool
                        is particularly adept at preserving your Instagram
                        Stories,
                        ensuring you never miss a moment.

                        <b>Free and Easy to Use</b>: Our tool is entirely free
                        and designed with simplicity in mind. With just a few
                        clicks, you can
                        create a comprehensive archive of your Instagram
                        journey.

                    <li>
                        <b>Public profiles only</b>: While we could implement a
                        mechanism to try to connect with a profile user, we
                        won't do it to respect the user privacy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Limited use</b>: Right now we only download Instagram
                        stories, since these are viewer temporary. On the long
                        run, we will download more data (e.g., reels) to enrich
                        your experience.

                    <li>
                        <b>Downtimes</b>: Although built to live 24x7, data
                        hoarding is expensive. We will eventually run out of
                        space, so expect downtimes in those times until we find
                        an affordable solution.
